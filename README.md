## Table Of Contents
TODO: Autogenerate TOC

## What is a DI container?
A DI Container is a software library that provides DI function- ality and automates many of the tasks involved in Object Composition, Interception, and Lifetime Management. It’s an engine that resolves and manages object graphs.

## Installation
Todo: Add a brief instruction how to install UniDi. And a short list of possabilities: From eg. from git, OpenUPM, release or Unity Asset Store.
Preferably only instruct how to use UAM.

## Usage 
TODO: The next section is usage, in which you instruct other people on how to use your project after they’ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.

## Contributing
TODO: Larger projects often have sections on contributing to their project, in which contribution instructions are outlined. Sometimes, this is a separate file. If you have specific contribution preferences, explain them so that other developers know how to best contribute to your work. To learn more about how to help others contribute, check out the guide for setting guidelines for repository contributors.

## Credits
TODO: Include a section for credits in order to highlight and link to the authors of your project.

## License
