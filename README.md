## What is a DI container?
A DI Container is a software library that provides DI function- ality and automates many of the tasks involved in Object Composition, Interception, and Lifetime Management. Itâ€™s an engine that resolves and manages object graphs.

## Installation

###Install via Git URL
Open ``Packages/manifest.json`` with your favorite text editor. Add the following line to the dependencies block.
```json
{
    "dependencies": {
        "com.unidi.unidi": "https://github.com/unidi/unidi.git",
    }
}
```
**Notice:** Unity Package Manager records the current commit to a lock entry of the manifest.json. To update to the latest version, change the ``"hash"`` value manually or just remove the lock entry to resolve the package.
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "com.unidi.unidi": {
      "version": "https://github.com/unidi/unidi.git",
      "depth": 0,
      "source": "git",
      "dependencies": {},
      "hash": "dd5027426f3dfecf2212fa7abe26365387ad080f"
    },
  }
}
```
### Install from file 
Download a release package to your computer. Press 'Add package from disk' in the Unity Package Manager and select the ``package.json`` in the extracted folder.
